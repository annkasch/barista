# Background Radiation and Inverse Source Tracking Algorithm (BaRISTA)

## Motivation

Achieving the required sensitivity in next-generation neutrinoless double-beta decay (0Î½Î²Î²) experiments (e.g., LEGEND, CUPID,..) depends on an accurate understanding of background distributions. Radioactiv decays can produce signals in the region of interest (ROI) of the energy spectrum, potentially mimicking 0Î½Î²Î² events.

## Introduction

This project introduces a novel approach to spectral decomposition and anomaly detection in rare-event physics experiments. The goal is to improve background modeling and signal extraction by leveraging machine learning-enhanced Bayesian inference.

### Key Concepts

Traditional background modeling approachesâ€”used in 0Î½Î²Î² experiments share a common approach, a binned Likelihood Fit to Energy Spectrum:
- The observed energy spectrum is modeled as a Poisson-distributed sum of individual contributions.
- Contributions are derived from Monte Carlo simulated spectra, integrated over specific detector response functions.

### Bottlenecks/Challenges:
- High Computational Cost: Traditional Monte Carlo simulations require excessive resources.
- Source Degeneracy: Background contributions are difficult to disentangle.
- Blind to Anomalies: Standard fitting methods struggle with unexpected spectral features.
